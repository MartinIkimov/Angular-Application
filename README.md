# Angular-Application

This is my project for the individual Project Assignment for the Angular Course at SoftUni.

The project aims to take the user on an adventure around our solar system and introduce them to the captivating world that lays beyond our planet.

The Project is build using Spring, MySQL DataBase, Angular and BootStrap. When uploading a photo, it is uploaded in Cloudinary. The 3D model of the planets were made using TreeJS. Every planet rotates using the mouse and on its own, they all rotate similarly as they do in real life. There is page pagination. Only the admin of the website has authorities to delete or edit all posts, otherwise you can delete or edit your posts only. People can comment on posts.
